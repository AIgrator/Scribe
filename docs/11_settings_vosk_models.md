### List of Installed Models

The main part of the screen is occupied by a table with the models already on your computer. It displays all the key information:
*   **Name:** The official name of the model.
*   **Size:** The model's size on disk.
*   **WER:** (Word Error Rate) — an indicator of the model's accuracy. The lower this value, the more accurate the model.

*   **Language:** The language that this model recognizes.

*   **Delete Selected Model:** Select a model and click this button to completely remove it from your computer. Be careful, this action is irreversible.

*   **Download New Models:** Clicking this button will open the familiar window you saw during the initial program setup. In it, you can select and download new models for other languages or more accurate versions for those already installed.
