# Section 7: Settings â€” Input

This tab allows you to fine-tune the exact method Scribe uses to insert recognized text into other applications.

### Parameters:

*   **Text Insertion Method:**
    *   **Clipboard:** This is the default mode. It works very quickly by pasting text via the system clipboard. **Note:** When using this method, your clipboard's content is temporarily saved and will be restored immediately after Scribe inserts the text.
    *   **Keyboard:** In this mode, the program simulates key presses, typing each character individually. This method can be more compatible with certain applications (like games or terminals) that do not support fast pasting.

*   **Delay Before Insertion (ms):** Sets a pause in milliseconds before the program begins to insert text.

*   **Delay Between Characters (ms):** This is active only for the "Keyboard" method. It defines the pause between the typing of each character.

### Important Configuration Notes

**We strongly recommend not changing these values unless absolutely necessary.**

The default settings have been calibrated for stable performance. In "Keyboard" mode, the program intentionally inserts text in chunks no more frequently than once every half-second (500 ms). This limitation was introduced to solve an issue where, during rapid dictation, the program could accidentally delete manually typed user text while removing a previous partial result.

This limitation has resolved the problem. Therefore, you should only change these parameters if you fully understand the consequences and are facing specific compatibility issues.
